Guagua Change Logs

Changes for Guagua-0.7.4
    * Validation data set chenage on Guagua side: add attachments for GuaguaInputSplit & GuaguaInputFormat
    * Fix a bug on embeded ZooKeeper logging enable
	* Fix a issue on Kerberos Hadoop: Kerberos is supported in guagua
	* Fix Guagua job stablility issue
Changes for Guagua-0.7.3
    * Master State Recovery
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/94
    * Add Combinable Interface to Merge Worker Results When Collecting
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/93
Changes for Guagua-0.7.2
    * Add GC timer for each iteration.
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/90
    * Change Embeded zooKeeper default memory from 1G to 512M
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/89
    * Add completion call back for master and worker
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/88
    * Auto-retry for bagging failed job.
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/77
Changes for Guagua-0.7.1
    * Change license from eBay to PayPal
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/83
    * Fix a bug to let user set 'mapreduce.job.max.split.locations' 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/84
Changes for Guagua-0.7.0
    * Add workers partial complete feature: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/81
      'guagua.min.workers.ratio' by default is 1.0, if set to 0.99, means in each iteration master only wait for 99% 
      workers. 'guagua.min.workers.timeout': if waiting time over such parameter (default 60000 ms), 
      'guagua.min.workers.ratio' will be considered. 
Changes for Guagua-0.6.1
    * Quick fix a bug on Netty Maven dependency:
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/76
Changes for Guagua-0.6.0
    * Add TCP server/client to send/receive results in both master and workers: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/65.
      This issue is to decrease dependency on zookeeper while master results are still stored into zookeeper for fault 
      tolerance. With this feature, no need to depend on a zookeeper cluster with enough memory and disk. User need not 
      specify zookeeper server used in shifu and guagua. 
    * Add memory+(local)disk feature to scale data volume worker can process: https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/54.
    * Add feature to start internal zookeeper server as a process in node of master process: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/14.
    * Extract common hadoop classes and APIs to the same packages for in both guagua-mapreduce and guagua-yarn: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/28.
    * Embedded zookeeper server(in client node or master node) imporvement: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/62; https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/61
    * Add feature to kill straggling container if over configured threshold in guagua-yarn component: 
      https://github.com/ShifuML/guagua/issues/52.
Changes for Guagua-0.5.0
    * Add annotation ComputableMonitor to support worker time out for each iteration. 
    * Change worker results in MasterContext from a List to Iteratable to save memory in master.
    * Add logistic regression example in guagua-mapreduce-examples.
    * Add linear regression example in guagua-mapreduce-examples.
Changes for Guagua-0.4.2
    * Add internal(embeded) ZooKeeper support.
    * Add default total iteration number if user don't set '-c'.
    * Improve readme and other guagua docs.
Changes for Guagua-0.4.1
    * Improve guagua shell to follow hadoop command.
    * Add kmeans example in guagua-mapreduce-examples.
    * Improve API java docs.
Changes for Guagua-0.4.0
    * Consistent guagua package in guagua-client. For this package, we have a shell 'guagua' help user select the 
      platform, user only needs to set the jar, the master and worker classes and other guagua or mapred parameters by 
      using '-D<key=value>'.
    * Support jobs run in Parallel in GuaguaMapReduceClient, only mapreduce adapter support it, yarn adapter doesn't 
      support it.
Changes for Guagua-0.3.0
    * Delete unneeded ZooKeeper znodes ASAP, for example: in iteration 4, delete all znodes from iteration 1 and 2, node
      remove znodes for iteration 3 because of fail-over needed.
    * Improve Hadoop mapper progress to make sure users can get accurate progress in web and console.
    * Improve neural network implementation.
    * Fulfill guagua client input validation.
    * Add slow task detection mechanism, if one task iteration execution time is over a threshold value, task will kill 
      itself to trigger fail-over task on other machines.
Changes for Guagua-0.2.0
    * Make guagua mapreduce work on Hadoop 0.20.2, 1.2.0 and 2.2.0, test guagua mapreduce on apache, cloudera, 
      hortonworks hadoop distributions.
    * Change default task gc to concurrent gc to decrease gc stopping time to avoid ZooKeeper session timeout.
    * Build two packages for guagua-mapreduce to make guagua work on hadoop 1.0 and hadoop yarn.
    * Make guagua yarn works, token setting in GuaguaAppMaster.
    * Fix the bug: OOM for zookeeper and OOD(disk) for zookeeper.
    * Any exception guagua will send kill task signal to Job Tracker to make sure issue task can be killed.
    * Add detailed info to mapper status for user to check.
Changes for Guagua-0.1.0
    * Master-Workers services implementation for whole guagua arch.
    * Sync and async ZooKeeper coordinators for both master and workers.
    * MapReduce adapter implementation by using only mapper tasks.
    * YARN adapter implementation with fail-over like mapreduce tasks. By default each task has 4 attempts.
    * Guagua-core fail-over support to make restarted-task starts at last successful iteration.
    * Basic IO for master result and worker results and adapter for hadoop writable.
    * Add examples: sum values and distributed neural network implementation.
    * Make all intercepters and properties set by hadoop like commnad: '-D<key=value>'.
    * Input splits like Pig: set combination size, guagua can combine each worker according to the size.
    * Profile intercepter liker memory profilers and worker timers.
